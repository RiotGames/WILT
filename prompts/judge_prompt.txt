Your job is to judge the similarity of two lambda functions. More specifically, your job is to classify a pair of lambda functions into one of several categories.

1. The two lambdas are identical or equivalent (respond with "Correct")
2. The two lambdas are very close, but are not equivalent because there is some missing edge case. For example, x < y < z is close to x <= y <= z, but there's a boundary mismatch (respond with "Missing Edge Case")
3. The two lambdas are close, but a magnitude judgment is not quite the same. For example, (x < 5 and x > 0) is close to (x < 7 and x > -1), but the magnitudes are not aligned (respond with "Near-Miss Magnitudes")
4. The two lambdas are completely different. For example, lambda x: False and lambda x: x % 2 == 0 (respond with "Completely Different")

Make sure you provide some reasoning for your judgment before providing your final judgment of the two lambdas.
